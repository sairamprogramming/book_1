This chapter is on arrays, linked lists and selection sort.

                        Arrays                  Linked Lists

Reading:                  O(1)                       O(n)

Insertion:                O(n)                       O(1)

Deletion:                 O(n)                       O(1)

O(n) = Linear Time
O(1) = Constant Time

Computer memory can be thought of as, a cabinet full of drawers.
Each drawer(memory cell) has it's own address through which it can be accessed.

Example:
  If you want to store some item in the computer memory, you ask the computer
  for some space, it will give you the address of a memory cell where you can
  store the item.

They are two basic ways to store multiple items:
                  - arrays
                  - linked lists

An array is a data structure in which all it's item (or data,elements) are
stored contiguously(right next to each other) in the computer's memory.

The computer assigns memory to arrays in a block the size of the array.

Inserting items at the end of an array causes the computer to look for a new
memory location of size array + 1, to accommodate the new item.

As can be seen above, insertion at the end of an array are inefficient.

Another downside of an array is that in case the computer has to move the
entire array due to insertion, then it must look for a contiguously free memory
location of the size array + 1, This may not always be possible as the computers
resources of this size may not be free as a continuous block of memory.

The above problems of inefficient insertions are solved by using a linked list
data structure.

In a linked list each item stores it's value along with the address of the
next location and the location of the previous location.

A bunch of random addresses are linked together in this fashion.

With linked list you never have to move the entire structure to accommodate an
item, you also do not have to worry about find large chunks of memory to be
free. Each linked list cell only has to have enough space for it's value,
addresses of the previous and the next location, this is comparatively smaller
than finding memory for an entire array of values.

To note that the overhead of a linked list is larger than that of an array.

What i mean by this is that if i want to store x values, it will take overall
less space as an array then as an linked list(since linked lists need to keep
track of previous and next addresses) .

The problem with linked list is you do not have random access to each of it's
memory location.
If you want to read the last item(element) in the linked list you have to walk
through the entire list to get to it.(since all the cells are in random
locations)

In case of arrays we know the location of all it's element(since each element
is stored in continuous memory locations).
Above property of arrays allows us to have random access to any of it's elements
all we need to know is the address of the first(zeroth) element and the position
of the element from the first element(index), this will allow us to calculate
the memory location of the required element.

Above also gives another downside to array data structure, each of its element
must be of the same size so that we may get random access to any of its
elements.

Inserting into the middle of a list:
  In case of a list if you want to insert in the middle, all you need to do is
  modify the pointer of appropriate two list cell to accommodate the new item
  in the required position.

  In the case of array if you want to insert in the middle, you need to shift
  all the elements down. Also the problem with there not being enough space for
  the new element, causes a migration of the entire array to a new memory
  location if there is no free space at the end of the array.

  The worst case for the array is inserting at the beginning, this will cause
  all the elements in to be shifted down, that is a lot of operations.
  This has a running time of O(n).

Deletions:
  In this case to list are better.

    In case of list all you need to do is modify where the previous element
    points to.

    In case of list we need to move up everything below the deleted element.

    The worst case in the array is the deletion of the first element, it causes
    all the elements below it to me moved up. Has a runtime of O(n).

  Deletions will always work.

  Insertions may fail some times when there is no memory left.

There are two different types of access to elements:

                - sequential access
                - Random access

Sequential access means reading the elements one by one, starting with the
first element.
Example is linked lists.

Random access means you can jump directly to any element in the data structure
directly. Another way of saying that lookup is constant time(O(1)).
Example is arrays.
